# 3D-detector-from-scratch
This is the work I have made as part of my thesis. It is a *from-scratch* implementation of a 3D detector. 
This work relies heavily on the SECOND detector (https://github.com/traveller59/second.pytorch.git) and some parts of the code are coppied from the original repository. 
The project structure resembles the one of OpenPCDet repository (https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet.git)



Requirements:
  - PyTorch
  - spconv 1.2
  - MinkowskiEngine
  - torchsparse
  - Open3D
